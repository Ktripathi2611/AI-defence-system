# AI Cyber Defense Platform

A comprehensive AI-powered platform designed to combat cyber-crimes and enhance user safety. The platform includes a backend API, frontend web application, and Chrome extension for real-time threat detection.

## üåü Features

- **URL Analysis**: Real-time detection of phishing and malicious URLs
- **Deepfake Detection**: AI-powered analysis of images and videos
- **Threat Reporting**: User-driven threat reporting system
- **Chrome Extension**: Real-time website safety monitoring
- **Dashboard**: Comprehensive threat monitoring and statistics

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The platform consists of three main components:

### 1. Backend (FastAPI)

Located in `/backend/`:

- **main.py**: Core API server with endpoints for URL analysis, media processing, and threat reporting
- **models/**
  - **url_analyzer.py**: ML-based URL analysis with feature extraction
  - **threat_detector.py**: Deepfake detection using EfficientNetB0
  
Key Features:
- Asynchronous request handling
- ML model integration
- File upload processing
- CORS support
- Error handling and logging

### 2. Frontend (React)

Located in `/frontend/`:

- **Components/**
  - **DeepFakeDetector**: Media upload and analysis interface
  - **ThreatAwareness**: Educational content about cyber threats
  - **ReportThreat**: Threat reporting interface
  - **Navbar**: Navigation component
- **Pages/**
  - Dashboard, Analysis, Reports pages
- **Services/**
  - API integration
  - State management

### 3. Chrome Extension

Located in `/chrome-extension/`:

- **popup.html/js**: Extension UI and core functionality
- **background.js**: Background processes and threat monitoring
- **manifest.json**: Extension configuration
- **styles.css**: UI styling

Features:
- Real-time URL analysis
- Threat statistics
- Recent threats history
- One-click reporting

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 14+
- Docker (optional)

### Installation

1. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Chrome Extension Setup**
   - Open Chrome
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable Developer Mode
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `/chrome-extension` directory

### Running the Application

1. **Start Backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Start Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Docker Deployment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

## üîß Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
# Backend
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/db
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
MODEL_PATH=path/to/models

# Frontend
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```
